I got to [lesson 62](https://acim.org/workbook/lesson-62/) in
this "religious" thing and _not_ science "ACIM" where you have
to read one lesson a day each day for 365 days.

This AsciiByteToBase9 I wrote in golang just to cement into my brain
what my function is. I'm a programmer, I should understand what
my function is right?

According to ACIM-62 this is the logic.

But then the base9 stuff is just interesting to note.
